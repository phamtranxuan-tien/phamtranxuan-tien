# 👋 Hi, I'm Tien Pham

🔬 **AI Researcher | Learner for Life**  

I’m passionate about **artificial intelligence, computer vision, and generation**.  
Currently, I spend most of my time working on:  
- 🛡️ **Adversarial Attacks & Robustness** – exploring how deep learning models (YOLO, DINO, VarifocalNet, etc.) behave under adversarial conditions in **aerial imagery**.  
- 🤖 **Generative Models & Detection** – studying how to **detect AI-generated images** using natural noise and advanced techniques (e.g., AEROBLADE, ZeroFake).  

---

## 📌 Featured Interests
- 🛰️ Applying **AI to aerial imagery** for real-world use cases (UAVs, remote sensing).  
- 🎯 Designing **robust AI models** that can withstand black-box and physical-world adversarial attacks.  
- 🎶 Music fuels my thinking – I’m a huge **Radiohead** fan (yes, *Everything in Its Right Place* is on repeat 🎧).

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Generalizable **AI-generated image detection**
- **Personalized Generation**

✨ *I believe in learning deeply, breaking things down, and building them back stronger.*
